    <abstract>
      <t> Segment routing uses globally known labels to accomplish
      destination-based forwarding along shortest paths computed using
      Dijkstra's algorithm with IGP metrics.  Segment routing also
      allows one to accomplish destination-based forwarding along
      paths computed using other algorithms.  Segment routing also
      supports multi-topology routing, and it supports the use of
      other algorithms combined with multi-topology routing.  This
      draft compares two different options for associating labels with
      different algorithms and topologies, and it proposes IS-IS
      extensions to encode the per-topology/per-algorithm label block
      option.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t> <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing"/> describes
      the segment routing architecture.  In segment routing, LDP-like
      forwarding behavior along shortest paths is achieved using
      globally known node labels.  Globally known node labels can be
      distributed by having each
      router advertise a globally unique node index value as well
      as a locally assigned label block, allowing any router in the
      IGP area to determine the mapping of locally assigned label to
      globally unique node index for any other router in the area.
      </t>

      <t> <xref target="fig_spf_label_formula"/> shows the formula
      used to determine the locally significant label values
      corresponding to shortest path forwarding next-hops computed
      using Dijkstra's shortest path first algorithm with IGP metrics,
      which is the default mode of operation for segment routing.

      <t> As a simple example, when the computing node (Y) needs to
      forward a packet ultimately destined for node D, Y first
      determines the shortest path next-hop node to reach D, which we
      assume to be X in this example.  Y then adds the Node_Index
      value advertised by D to the Label_Block value advertised by X
      to determine the label value to apply to the packet before
      sending it to X.

      <t> The computing router (Y) needs to forward a packet destined
      for node D using next-hops computed by algorithm A.  Using
      either option, Y determines the next-hop computed by algorithm A
      to reach D, which we assume to be X in this example.  Y then
      needs to figure out the correct label to apply to the packet so

      <t>In Option 1a each node advertises a unique node index for each

      option. This draft proposes extensions that can be used to

      However, before discussing those extensions, we generalize the
      formula in <xref target="fig_algo_label_formulas"/> further to

      example, if the use case uses multiple topologies but only uses
      the default shortest path algorithm (algorithm=0), then option 2
      can be written as: Label(X,D,T,0) = Label_Block(X,T,0) +
      Node_Index(D), which is independent of algorithm.  Similarly, if
      the use case only uses the default topology (topology=0) but
      uses different algorithms, then option 2 can be
      written as Label(X,D,0,A) = Label_Block(X,0,A) + Node_Index(D).

    </section>

    <section title="A simple example">
      <t> The following example illustrates the practical difficulties
      associated with using the per-topology/per-algorithm node index
      option (option 1) alone.  This example is intentionally
      simplified to illustrate the need for some kind of convention to
      manage the assignment of the unique node index values required
      by option 1, even in a simple scenario.  The sections below
      discuss a more complex example, as well as a specific proposal
      to manage the assignment of unique node index values.  This
      simplified example assumes that the operator does not use
      multi-topology routing, i.e. that the default topology is used.
      </t>

      <t> Suppose an operator has a network with 100 nodes, which we
      will refer to as R0-R99.  The operator assigns the unique node
      index values 0-99 to those nodes for algorithm=0, in order to
      accomplish shortest path routing based on IGP metrics with SR
      labels.  Each node will need to advertise a label block of
      size=100.
      </t>

      <t> Assume that at some future point in time, the IETF defines
      algorithm=2 to mean shortest path routing based on latency, and
      vendors implement this.  Suppose that the operator wants to use
      latency-based SPF routes for some traffic and metric-based SPF
      routes for other traffic.  The operator will need to define a
      new set of unique node index values for algorithm=2.  A
      reasonable choice would be to assign node index values of 100-199
      to R0-R99 for algorithm=2.  Each node will now need to advertise
      a label block of size=200.  So far the need for per-algorithm
      node index values is an annoyance, but not too difficult to deal
      with.
      </t>

      <t>Now assume that the operator needs to add 10 new nodes to the
      SR domain, specifically nodes R100-R109.  Each node will now
      need to advertise a label block of size=220.  The main issue is
      deciding how to assign per-algorithm node index for the 10 new
      nodes.  One option is to redo the node index numbering scheme so
      that R0-R109 have node index values 0-109 for algorithm=0 and
      node index values 110-229 for algorithm=2.  However, this
      requires renumbering existing nodes.  The other option is to
      avoid renumbering of nodes by assigning nodes R100-R109 node
      index values 200-209 for algorithm=0 and node index values
      210-219 for algorithm=1. Each of these approaches has drawbacks.
      The first requires renumbering existing nodes, while the second
      is difficult to maintain since there is no obvious relationship
      between the node index values for different algorithms.
      </t>

      <t>In order to reduce the complexity associated with option 1 in
      this simple example, a certain amount of pre-planning together
      with some convention for assigning node index values to
      algorithms or topologies would be useful.  Specific proposals
      for managing unique node index values when using option 1 are
      discussed below.  First however, we illustrate the advantages of
      option 2 for this simple example.
      </t>

      <t>The use of per-algorithm label blocks avoids the problems
      associated with assigning and maintaining unique node index
      values for each forwarding algorithm.
      </t>

      <t>When the SR domain is initially deployed, R0-R99 can be
      assigned node index values 0-99, as one would expect.  When
      support for algorithm=1 gets added, the operator does not need
      to assign and configure any new node index values.  Instead, the
      routers automate the process by advertising different label
      blocks for each forwarding algorithm.
      </t>

      <t>When another 10 nodes are added to the SR domain, R100-R109
      get assigned node index values 100-109 as one would expect.  And
      the router advertises a label block of size=110 for each
      algorithm, as one would expect.  Adding new nodes in the
      presence of multiple forwarding algorithms is simplified
      significantly with the use of per-algorithm label blocks.

    <section anchor="sec_proposed_method" title="Proposed configured offset mapping method">
      <t> The method described in this section represents the authors
      understanding of this proposal as discussed on the SPRING
      mailing list.  
      </t>

      <t> One method for managing the assignment of unique node index
      values for each topology/algorithm pair involves configuring a
      mapping from each topology/algorithm pair to an offset value.
      This offset mapping would need to be configured identically on
      every router in the network.  <xref
      target="fig_configured_offset_mapping_method"/> shows the
      formula for a router Y to compute its own unique node index
      value for each topology/algorithm pair.  Y would then treat
      those computed node index values as if they were directly
      configured via CLI or via Netconf/Yang, advertising them into
      the IGP and installing the appropriate label operations in the
      FIB.
      </t>

]]></artwork>
</figure>

      <t> We illustrate the operation of the configured offset mapping
      method with a specific example.  In this example, the operator
      has a network with 500 nodes, and wants to support four
      different topologies using different algorithms.  The default
      topology (topology=0) needs to support algorithms 0, 4, and 5.
      Topology 2 and topology 6 need to support algorithm 0, while
      topology 7 needs to support algorithm 2. There are a total of
      six topology/algorithm pairs.  In order to avoid renumbering the
      network in the event of unanticipated increases in the number of
      nodes or the number of topology/algorithm pairs, the operator
      sizes the label offsets and overall label block size to
      accomodate 1000 nodes and 12 topology/algorithm pairs.
      </t>

      <t> <xref target="fig_example_5_topo_N_algo_option_1"/> shows
      the configuration data required on each of the 500 routers using
      option 1 together with the configured offset mapping method to manage
      node index assigment. 
      </t>

topology=2 algorithm=0 offset=3000
topology=6 algorithm=0 offset=4000
topology=7 algorithm=2 offset=5000
]]></artwork>
</figure>

      <t> The base_node_index value is the unique node index for a
      given node, and will thus be different for each node.  The other
      values define the overall size of the label block and associate
      topology algorithm pairs with an offset value.  This set of
      values must be configured identically across all routers in the
      network in order avoid advertising duplicate node index values.
      Advertisement of duplicate node index values would disrupt
      forwarding.  The configuration above would result in R123
      computing node index values of 123, 1123, 2123, 3123, 4123, and
      5123 for the corresponding topology/algorithm pairs.</t>

      <t> For comparison, <xref
      target="fig_example_5_topo_N_algo_option_2"/> shows the
      configuration data required on each of the 500 routers using
      option 2.  Since the per-topology/per-algorithm label blocks are
      advertised independently by each node, option 2 requires no
      additional configuration beyond what is required for default
      topology shortest path forwarding (topology=0, algorithm=0).

    <section title="Flexibilty to create easy-to-interpret label values">
      <t> For some applications, it may be desirable to arrange things
      so that the meaning of label values used for forwarding can be
      readily understood by people trouble-shooting the network.  When
      using the configured offset mapping method with option 1, if one
      configures a meaningful base value for the single label block,
      then the configured offset values can also be chosen to provide
      understandable label values.  In the example above with 500
      nodes and 6 topology/algorithm pairs, if the single logically
      advertised label block consists of a single numerically
      contiguous label block from 20000 through 31999 across all
      routers in the network, then the label values corresponding to
      forwarding to R123 using different topology/algorithm pairs will
      be meaningful to a people.  They will be 20123, 21123, 22123,
      23123, 24123, and 25123 for the corresponding topology/algorithm
      pairs, so an operator who remembers the mapping between
      topology/alogorithm pair and offset can tell that 25123 is the
      label corresponding to topology=7, algorithm=2, node=123.
      </t>

      <t> When using option 2 (per-topology/per-algorithm label
      blocks) and requiring that the topology, algorithm, and node
      associated with a label value be easy to interpret, each
      topology/algorithm pair needs to have an associated
      label_block_base configured on every router.  <xref
      target="fig_example_500_option_2"/> show an example
      configuration of a mapping from topology/algorithm pairs to
      label_block_base values.
      </t>  

<figure anchor="fig_example_500_option_2" title="Configuration data for 500 node example with option 2, " align="center">

topology=6 algorithm=0 label_block_base=160000
topology=7 algorithm=2 label_block_base=172000
]]></artwork>
</figure>

      <t>Note in this example that we have taken advantage of the
      additional flexibility of option 2 to create label values that
      are more readable than from option 1.  In this example, a first
      digit of "1" indicates that this is a SPRING node label.  The
      second and third digits are readable as the topology and
      algorithm, while the last three digits encode the node number.
      So 172123 would indicate the node label for topology=7,
      algorithm=2, node=123.
      </t>

      <t> In the above example, we have illustrated the flexiblity of
      option 2 to create more readable labels in a hypothetical
      network with no constraints on label space.  However, it is
      likely that in a multi-vendor network with multiple generations
      of hardware supporting different MPLS applications there will
      exist constraints regarding the location and size of contiguous
      label blocks for use by SPRING.  This would impose constraints
      one's ability to construct readable label values using option 1
      with the configurable offset mapping method.  Option 2 provides
      more flexibility to construct easy-to-interpret label values in
      such a network.
      </t>

    </section>
    
    <section title="Robustness against misconfiguration">
      <t> In the simple case where the application does not require
      easy-to-interpret label values, option 2 has clear advantages
      over option 1 in terms of robustness again misconfiguration.
      Option 1 requires identical offset mapping configurations on all
      routers for proper forwarding.  Option 2 requires no
      configuration, so there is nothing to misconfigure.
      </t>

      <t> In scenarios requiring easy-to-interpet label values, where
      option 2 requires a label_block_base mapping configuration,
      option 2 is still more robust against misconfiguration than
      option 1.  Misconfiguration of the label_block_base mapping in
      option 2 does not affect forwarding.  The explicit advertisement
      of the per-topology/per-algorithm label blocks ensures that
      forwarding will continue to work properly.

      <t> The newly-defined Topology-Algorithm-Label-Block sub-TLV is
      shown in <xref target="fig_topo_algo_label_block_sub_tlv"/>.  It
      is carried in the IS-IS Router Capability TLV-242.  It contains
      a 12-bit MT-ID field as well as an 8-bit Algorithm field which
      associates the SRGB Descriptor entries carried in the sub-TLV
      with a particular topology and algorithm. Otherwise, the
      structure and interpretation of the
      Topology-Algorithm-Label-Block sub-TLV is identical to that of
      the SR-Capabilities sub-TLV defined in section 3.1 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions"/>.

      <t> A single network must use either option 1 or option 2 for
      all routers.  Mixed mode operation is not supported.  When the
      Topology-Algorithm-Label-Block sub-TLV is present with a given
      pair of topology and algorithm values, routers MUST determine
      the label values associated with that topology/algorithm pair
      using the per-topology/per-algorithm label block method and the
      concatenated label block carried by the
      Topology-Algorithm-Label-Block sub-TLV.  The node indices used
      in this calculation are those carried in Node-SID advertisements
      with algorithm value=0 in TLV-135(IPv4) or TLV-236(IPv6). 
      </t>

      <t> The Topology-Algorithm-Label-Block sub-TLV MUST NOT be
      advertised with both MT-ID=0 and Algorithm value=0.  In this
      way, the concatenated label block used to compute the label
      values for the default topology and algorithm=0 can only be
      carried by the SR Capabilities sub-TLV.</t>

      <t>When using the Topology-Algorithm-Label-Block sub-TLV in a
      network, nodes SHOULD only advertise a node index value
      corresponding to algorithm=0 in Node-SID advertisements in
      TLV-135(IPv4) and/or TLV-236(IPv6).  Node index values (with
      algorithm=0 or any other value) SHOULD NOT be advertised in
      TLV-235(MT-IPv4) and TLV-237(MT-IPv6).  If a node originates the
      Topology-Algorithm-Label-Block sub-TLV (meaning that it supports
      option 2), then it MUST ignore the reciept of node indices for
      non-zero algorithms in TLV-135 and TLV-236 and any node index
      values in TLV-235 and TLV-237.</t>

      <t>This document proposes the use of per-topology/per-algorithm
      label blocks to support destination-based forwarding along
      next-hops computed using different algorithms for different
      topologies.  The automated advertisement of
      per-topology/per-algorithm label blocks significantly simplifes
